# 30 Days of Frontend Development

This repository documents my 30-day journey of rebuilding frontend fundamentals.

I am starting with HTML and focusing on:
- Clean structure
- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility basics
- Forms and media

I will build something small every day using only HTML before moving to CSS and JavaScript.
